SQL Schema
Table: Failed

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| fail_date    | date    |
+--------------+---------+
fail_date is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the days of failed tasks.
 

Table: Succeeded

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| success_date | date    |
+--------------+---------+
success_date is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the days of succeeded tasks.
 

A system is running one task every day. Every task is independent of the previous tasks. The tasks can fail or succeed.

Write an SQL query to generate a report of period_state for each continuous interval of days in the period from 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31.

period_state is 'failed' if tasks in this interval failed or 'succeeded' if tasks in this interval succeeded. Interval of days are retrieved as start_date and end_date.

Return the result table ordered by start_date.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Failed table:
+-------------------+
| fail_date         |
+-------------------+
| 2018-12-28        |
| 2018-12-29        |
| 2019-01-04        |
| 2019-01-05        |
+-------------------+
Succeeded table:
+-------------------+
| success_date      |
+-------------------+
| 2018-12-30        |
| 2018-12-31        |
| 2019-01-01        |
| 2019-01-02        |
| 2019-01-03        |
| 2019-01-06        |
+-------------------+
Output: 
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| period_state | start_date   | end_date     |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| succeeded    | 2019-01-01   | 2019-01-03   |
| failed       | 2019-01-04   | 2019-01-05   |
| succeeded    | 2019-01-06   | 2019-01-06   |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
Explanation: 
The report ignored the system state in 2018 as we care about the system in the period 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31.
From 2019-01-01 to 2019-01-03 all tasks succeeded and the system state was "succeeded".
From 2019-01-04 to 2019-01-05 all tasks failed and the system state was "failed".
From 2019-01-06 to 2019-01-06 all tasks succeeded and the system state was "succeeded".

-- DML 
Create table If Not Exists Failed (fail_date date)
Create table If Not Exists Succeeded (success_date date)
Truncate table Failed
insert into Failed (fail_date) values ('2018-12-28')
insert into Failed (fail_date) values ('2018-12-29')
insert into Failed (fail_date) values ('2019-01-04')
insert into Failed (fail_date) values ('2019-01-05')
Truncate table Succeeded
insert into Succeeded (success_date) values ('2018-12-30')
insert into Succeeded (success_date) values ('2018-12-31')
insert into Succeeded (success_date) values ('2019-01-01')
insert into Succeeded (success_date) values ('2019-01-02')
insert into Succeeded (success_date) values ('2019-01-03')
insert into Succeeded (success_date) values ('2019-01-06')
OK

-- My Solution 

with all_together as 
(
     select 'failed' as period_state,fail_date as dte from failed where fail_date between '2019-01-01' and '2019-12-31'
     union all 
     select 'succeeded' as period_state,success_date as dte from succeeded where success_date between '2019-01-01' and '2019-12-31'            
),
prev_state as 
(
     select period_state , dte , lag(period_state,1) over (order by dte)prev   from all_together 
),
status as 
(    select
           period_state,dte,
           case when period_state = prev then 0 else 1 end as status
     from prev_state
)
select period_state,
       min(dte) as start_date , 
       max(dte) as end_date 
from 
     (  select period_state ,
