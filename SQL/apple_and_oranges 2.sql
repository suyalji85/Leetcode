Example 1:

Input: 
Sales table:
+------------+------------+-------------+
| sale_date  | fruit      | sold_num    |
+------------+------------+-------------+
| 2020-05-01 | apples     | 10          |
| 2020-05-01 | oranges    | 8           |
| 2020-05-02 | apples     | 15          |
| 2020-05-02 | oranges    | 15          |
| 2020-05-03 | apples     | 20          |
| 2020-05-03 | oranges    | 0           |
| 2020-05-04 | apples     | 15          |
| 2020-05-04 | oranges    | 16          |
+------------+------------+-------------+
Output: 
+------------+--------------+
| sale_date  | diff         |
+------------+--------------+
| 2020-05-01 | 2            |
| 2020-05-02 | 0            |
| 2020-05-03 | 20           |
| 2020-05-04 | -1           |
+------------+--------------+
Explanation: 
Day 2020-05-01, 10 apples and 8 oranges were sold (Difference  10 - 8 = 2).
Day 2020-05-02, 15 apples and 15 oranges were sold (Difference 15 - 15 = 0).
Day 2020-05-03, 20 apples and 0 oranges were sold (Difference 20 - 0 = 20).
Day 2020-05-04, 15 apples and 16 oranges were sold (Difference 15 - 16 = -1).

with apple as
(
    select 
        sale_date , 
        sum(sold_num) as 'apples'
        from sales
    where fruit = "apples"
    group by sale_date
),
orange as
(
    select

        sum(sold_num) as 'oranges'
        from sales
    where fruit = "oranges"
    group by sale_date
)
select 
    apple.sale_date ,
    (apple.apples - orange.oranges)as diff
from apple 
inner join orange
on apple.sale_date = orange.sale_date;
