Having tasks stuck in the Queue state?

Here are the reasons and the solutions to fix that! ğŸ‘‡

ğŸš¨ You reached the maximum number of running task instances for a DAG Run
ğŸ‘‰ Increase max_active_tasks

ğŸš¨ There is no more worker slot available in the pool to execute your tasks
ğŸ‘‰ Increase the number of slots in the corresponding pool

ğŸš¨ Miscommunication between Celery/RabbitMQ with stalled_task_timeout defaulted to 0
ğŸ‘‰ Set stalled_task_timeout between 300 to 600 seconds

ğŸš¨ You reached the max number of running tasks in your Airflow instance
ğŸ‘‰ Increase parallelism (default: 32)

ğŸš¨ You defined a custom worker queue, and tasks are stuck in queued
ğŸ‘‰ Check that the queue exists

ğŸš¨ Too many tasks triggered at the same time, causing a scale-up of the infra
ğŸ‘‰ The scale-up process can take time. Try to trigger fewer tasks at a time or increase the resources.
