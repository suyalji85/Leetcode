This is how I got interviews at 20+ companies in 3 months.

When I was applying for jobs around an year ago, I've followed a particular pattern in applying and here's that.

1) Made a list of 75 companies I wanted to apply to.
2) Sent out 100 LinkedIn personalized requests every week to recruiters working at those companies.
3) Connected with atleast 2-3 recruiters at every company and made initial conversations with them.
4) Told them I'm going to reach out to them after my preparation ends in 3 months.
5) When my preparation was close to over, I reached out to same recruiters I already connected with the job profiles matching me from careers page for interviews.
6) Scheduled 2-3 interviews every single day without wasting time.
