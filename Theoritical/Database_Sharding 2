What is Database Sharding?

It is a technique used to scale a database by horizontally partitioning the data across multiple servers, or shards. The goal of sharding is to distribute the data and workload across multiple servers, so that each server can handle a smaller portion of the overall data and workload. This can help improve the performance and scalability of the database, as each server can process queries and updates more efficiently when it is working with a smaller amount of data.

The most common methods for implementing data sharding are as follows:

Range-based sharding: This technique involves partitioning the data based on a specific key value such as user ID or timestamp. The data is distributed across the shards based on the range of the key value.

Hash-based sharding: In this approach, a hash function is used to distribute the data across the shards based on the key value.

Directory-based sharding: A central directory is used to map the key values to the specific shard where the data is stored.

Custom sharding: In some cases, a custom sharding strategy that is specific to the needs and requirements of the database and the applications using it may be necessary. This can involve a combination of different sharding methods or a completely unique approach.
