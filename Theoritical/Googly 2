1️⃣. Recruiter reached out to me and I showed interest in interviewing over a call.

2️⃣. I had a screening round where I was asked 1 medium question with a follow-up, follow-up wasn't expected to be coded.

3️⃣. I had three coding rounds in onsite.

i. Two medium questions.
ii. One hard question.
iii. One hard question.

All the code was written in a Google doc and all rounds had deep discussion of time and space complexity, optimisation of current approach.

4️⃣. Googlyness round: I was asked situation based and project based questions for 45 minutes.

5️⃣. Team-matching: I was asked questions similar to googlyness round but it also had an introduction of the team.

6️⃣. Hiring committee: I was supposed to only give some data to recruiter in this stage

7️⃣. Result and offer.

The whole process took ~6 months.

📍My recruiter was my best friend in the process. She was super helpful and helped me with resources and feedback everytime.

📍Final thoughts:
🔹What contributed to my success was clarity of concepts of all Data structures and algos. I had seen no question that was asked earlier in any platform. 🙌
🔹How you behave and talk in an interview matters a lot in your overall success.
🔹Time and space complexity has to be understood in depth.
