25 must-know concepts before your next system design interview:

1. Scalability - How will your system handle growth? Vertical or Horizontal scaling?

2. Latency and Throughput - Essential performance measures.

3. Database design - SQL or NoSQL? Understand their strengths and weaknesses.

4. Indexing - Understand database indexes and their performance implications.

5. Load Balancing - Understand different algorithms and their use cases.

6. Caching - Caching can dramatically increase the speed of data retrieval. Know different strategies, benefits and trade-offs.

7. Networking Basics - TCP/IP, HTTP vs HTTPS, UDP, DNS lookups.

8. Microservices Architecture - Learn how to decompose a large system into manageable parts.

9. Data Sharding - As your data grows, how will you distribute it?Understand different sharding techniques and their trade-offs.

10. CAP Theorem - Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance - you can only pick two.

11. System Interfaces - API design and best practices.

12. Redundancy and Failover - Learn how to design a highly available system.

13. Message Queues - Asynchronous communication, ensuring reliable data transfer.

14. Data Replication - Storing duplicate data across multiple machines to increase reliability and availability.

15. Concurrency - Handling multiple requests simultaneously.

16. Multithreading - The art of handling multiple threads and synchronization.

17. Rate Limiting - Controlling request rates, why, and how.

18. Consensus Algorithms - Get familiar with Raft, Paxos, and more.

19. Idempotency - Repeated requests should yield the same result.

20. REST vs RPC - When and why to use them.

21. Polling vs Push mechanism - Differences and their appropriate usage.

22. Heartbeats - Regular signals sent between machines to indicate network connectivity and system health.

23. Eventual vs Strong Consistency - Trade-offs and use cases.

24. Logging and Monitoring - Their significance in maintaining a healthy system.

25. Circuit Breakers - Learn how they can prevent system failures.
