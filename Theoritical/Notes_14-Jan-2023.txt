Compute engines have their strengths and weaknesses in #dataengineering

Spark
Strengths:
- can handle arbitrary scale
- Flexible APIs
- Can integrate tightly with Java backends
- platform agnostic
Weaknesses:
- latency is terrible
- tuning the jobs can be a nightmare
- a lot of gotchas around using UDFs, especially with PySpark


Presto/Trino
Strengths:
- lower latency
- robust UDF library
- great for dashboards and exploring data
- platform agnostic
Weaknesses:
- cannot handle arbitrary scale
- can only use SQL

Snowflake
Strengths:
- low latency
- the MERGE keyword
- easy integration with UDFs, much fewer gotchas than PySpark
- great compression
Weaknesses:
- vendor lock in
- pricey
- doesnâ€™t handle large scale well
